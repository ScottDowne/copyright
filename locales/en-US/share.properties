sharing_twitter_a=I just joined @mozilla in keeping the internet filter-free, by calling an MEP to #fixcopyright

# Will be used as a tweet. Length limit: 116 characters.
sharing_twitter_b=Tell @Europarl_EN: #copyright must aid innovation & creation, not curb it. How? A free call to MEPs:

# Do not use HTML elements
sharing_email_subject_a=Proposed EU Copyright laws are WRONG
# Do not use HTML elements
sharing_email_body_a=Europe’s proposals for copyright reform are not fit for the digital age. Under their new rules, publishers can monitor your uploads, fine you for posting links *and* remove your right to meme. I just called an MEP to tell them to FIX COPYRIGHT! https://www.changecopyright.org/

# Do not use HTML elements
sharing_email_internet_subject_b=The internet in the EU is under threat!
# Do not use HTML elements. Free is used as in “free beer”
sharing_email_body_b=Copyright laws that promote innovation and creation are key to a healthy internet. Current EU proposals do not reflect this, so I just called an MEP to help save copyright. With Mozilla’s free tool, you can too: https://www.changecopyright.org/
