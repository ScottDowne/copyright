To start local development, install and run the following commands:

``` bash
$ cp sample.env .env

$ npm start
```

## Develop Workflow

After successfully building and running the server, go to [localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)

You can now start changing files in the `/src` directory, such that saving your changes and refreshing the browser will show your changes.

Files outside of /src require npm start to be rerun.
